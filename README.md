# SmartCar-Sonar-V2
A fairly standard arduino smartcar robot, who roves around, scanning frantically by rotating his sonar detector like a pair of manic eyes, and avoids walls that way.  If you have built the same robot I have, you can also access the line detectors on the bottom (though this V2 code does not use those.)
